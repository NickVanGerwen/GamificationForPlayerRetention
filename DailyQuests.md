# Daily quests
## Mechanics
- Daily quests are goals you can work towards and complete in one day
- Completing a quest will give an xp reward
- You are shown when you make progress on a quest
- Each day you will be tasked with three different quests
- Daily quests come in three difficulty levels; easy, medium and hard
- Easy quests are completable in one game round
- A countdown timer shows when the daily quests will be refreshed

## Dynamics
### Sunk cost fallacy
As a result of increasing difficulty in daily quests, players will make progress in all of their quests while attempting to complete just one quest. This makes players more invested in completing the remaining quests because they have already made some progress, which would otherwise go to waste.

### FOMO
By making the quests only temporarily available, players will experience the fear of missing out(fomo). This will incentivize players to check and attempt to complete the quests every day to get the rewards they would otherwise miss out on. 

### Motivate players to open the app
One obstacle before playing the game is opening the app. Because quests can have many different motivations (needing xp to level up, fomo, curiosity for how easy the quests are) and because the barrier is very low (open the app, view quest menu) it serves as a good trigger to get players into the app, where they are then more likely to play the game, and make purchases.

### Satisfaction of competence
Completing challenges will make players feel good about themselves because they were able to complete them. This is paired with the actual reward, which makes it feel even more rewarding.

### Value of gameplay
The quests are often tasks that players would do regardless when they are playing the game(example: play x rounds, vote x times). By presenting regular gameplay as goals with tangible rewards, their gameplay feels more valuable. 

### Offer direction
Clearly defined goals (and their potential rewards) should guide players into a way of playing, like playing a certain category or inviting a big group of friends to play for a “play with x friends” quest.

### Trigger play
Players who have the motivation and ability to play, may be looking for a trigger to act on(Nir Eyal’s Hook model). A daily quest can serve as the motivating factor to start a game.

### Player choice
By providing multiple quests with no completion order, players are incentivized to choose a quest to focus on. This makes the player feel in control of their own goals, giving the completion of the goal more impact. 


### Variable Interval Schedule
By making high value quests an uncommon occurrence, with a variable interval, players are incentivized to open the app to check for high value quests(fomo). 

## Aesthetics
### Challenge
Players are given challenges to overcome, serving as a motivating factor to engage with the game and various mechanics.
