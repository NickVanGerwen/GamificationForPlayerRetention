# Gamification categories
To organise mechanics found during the research project I defined seven categories;

## Temporal
These encourage the players to play at designated times, or make them miss out if they donâ€™t. Some examples are daily login bonuses, limited-time events, or timed challenges. 
## Social
These are all mechanics that rely on the existence of other players to interact with. They can be divided into cooperative and competitive social mechanics. Cooperative mechanics promote teamwork and collaboration, while competitive mechanics foster rivalry and comparison among players.
## Progression
These give the player goals to work towards, and things to look forward to. These can drive players to participate in the core gameplay even after losing all excitement they experienced with it. Progression could be linear; such as levels and worlds, or branching; like different paths or abilities.
## Ownership
Entails all the control players have over the way they play, like different game modes or approaches, as well as their ability to customise the game's appearance, such as character creators or skins. It also includes the player's ownership of in-game assets, such as pet- or card collections.
## Luck
These are mechanics where luck plays a big role, often resulting in randomly selected rewards. These are commonly presented as slot machines, spinning wheels, and mystery chests. They need to balance excitement with frustration, and often include pseudo randomness and fail-safes to mitigate the negative effects of bad luck.
## Resources
In-game resources provide players with the joy of spending / shopping while not losing anything, as well as making in-app purchases more enticing by removing the real money relation to in-game items(gems). This also includes consumable items the player can use, and crafting materials. Different types of resources can serve different gameplay purposes and drive specific player behaviour.
## Accomplishments 
These serve to make the player's actions seem more valuable / important by celebrating them with achievements, badges, ratings, or points. These are often used when reaching certain milestones or completing difficult challenges.
