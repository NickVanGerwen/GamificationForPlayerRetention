## Categories
To organise the mechanics I make use of seven categories; temporal, social, progression, ownership, luck, resources, and accomplishments. Learn more about them here: [Gamification categories](https://github.com/NickVanGerwen/GamificationForPlayerRetention/blob/Readme/GamificationCategories.md)

## Results
