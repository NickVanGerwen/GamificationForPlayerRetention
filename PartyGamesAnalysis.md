# Party games analysis
Before implementing gamification mechanics within Vanilla, let's examine how the competitive landscape already utilizes gamification. This analysis delves into gamification strategies within party games to discern effective practices and uncover potential opportunities for enhancement. By understanding what works well in similar contexts, Vanilla can make informed decisions to optimize player engagement and retention.

## Games
I looked at the following apps;

## Categories
To organise the mechanics I make use of seven categories; temporal, social, progression, ownership, luck, resources, and accomplishments. Learn more about them here: [Gamification categories](https://github.com/NickVanGerwen/GamificationForPlayerRetention/blob/Readme/GamificationCategories.md)

## Results
|       | temporal | social                                                                                                                           | progression                                                       | ownership                                                                | luck                                                                                          | resources          | accomplishments |

## Observations

1. While not necessary to play the game, all seventeen games had some form of content selection. Most games also used this as the main driver behind IAP’s. This highlights the importance of applicable content in statement-based games.
2. Almost none of the gamification techniques found in the puzzle games analysis are present here. This is an opportunity to explore a different side of party games, while possibly gaining benefits of mechanics found outside of party games. 
3. Many of the social mechanics are intrinsic to the real-life games they are representing, like comparing players and answers for ‘most likely to’, ‘never have I ever’, and ‘would you rather’. There is an opportunity to apply social mechanics which are not normally available in the real world.
4. Not a single temporal mechanic is applied to the party games analysed. There is an opportunity to give different motivations to come back to the app. 
5. Classic resources like coins and gems are absent from the games analysed. This could be used to give the player more sense of ownership, as well as be a reward for certain actions. Resources could also combine with a cosmetics shop, increasing player choice and sense of ownership.
6. Many of these games are random in nature, through their nature as statement based games. Some of them use this fact to their advantage by highlighting the randomness with a spinning wheel or bottle.
7. Two games implemented a choose your own card mechanic, which shows multiple cards face-down, and let you choose a card, which then shows a statement or question. This builds on the real-life aspects of party games, while it doesn’t functionally chance the outcome, it increases the feeling of luck and player choice.
8. Games by GreenTomatoMedia implemented some unique luck based mechanics; when spinning a wheel to choose which player goes next there is a chance for a waiter to spin the bottle one further after it stopped. Another is a chance to get a card from a premium deck, this makes the player feel lucky, while giving the player a reminder of the premium content.
9. Game modifiers came in the form of additional rules during the game (ex. ‘Don’t touch the table’, or ‘end every sentence with “duhhh”’). These serve as a form of dynamic gameplay, allowing for variety without the need to implement complicated mechanics.
