# Player retention analytics and observations

## Mobile gaming market

### Average player retention over 30 days

<br />
This shows the average player retention of mobile games across different timespan. These timespan are the days since a player first opened the app, represented as D1 (one day after first open), D3 (three days after first open), etc. 

The decline indicates players are more likely to stop using an app as time goes on. Eventually the downwards trend levels out, leaving only the retained users.

### Player retention across categories
![player retention metrics across categories](https://github.com/NickVanGerwen/GamificationForPlayerRetention/blob/Readme/player%20retention%20charts/Player%20retention%20across%20categories.png)
<br />
Average D1 player retention across all categories is 31.46%, while party games score slightly higher at 32.33%. 

The largest categories in gaming, casino and match, both score even higher at 36.96% and 34.09% respectively. This trend continues after D3, D7, D14, and D30. 

This shows that some categories perform better than others in regards to player retention. This fact can be used as a basis for understanding how your metrics compare to that of the market you operate in.  It should be noted that bigger games are required to have higher D1 numbers than shown here in order to make it through soft launch, inflating metrics.   

### Gaming and non-gaming

<br />
The gaming categories have a player retention D1 average of 31.46%. The non-gaming categories have a D1 average user retention rate of 24.71%. This means gaming’s D1 average is 27.3%  higher than that of non-gaming. However, D14 and D30 retention rates show that non-gaming overtakes gaming in later benchmarks.

This may be because gaming apps often exclusively offer entertainment, increasing the likelihood of users trying out multiple apps until they find one they enjoy for longer. On the other hand, non-gaming apps offer functionality they might rely on, and thus, users return to them regularly.

### Android vs IOS

Since AppsFlyer also collected data on the operating system of the players, we can compare how player retention differs between them. You will notice that IOS clearly has higher average retention rates than Android, indicating higher brand loyalty.
