This shows the average player retention of mobile games across different timespan. These timespan are the days since a player first opened the app, represented as D1 (one day after first open), D3 (three days after first open), etc.Â 

The decline indicates players are more likely to stop using an app as time goes on. Eventually the downwards trends levels out, leaving only the retained users.
