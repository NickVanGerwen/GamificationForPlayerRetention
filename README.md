# Gamification for increased Player Retention
This central hub is dedicated to insights from Nick van Gerwen's research project on gamification and its impact on player retention. Designed specifically for Vanilla's development team, this platform aims to help you recognize gamification opportunities, identify potential improvements, and make informed design choices to enhance player retention.

## Player Retention
Player retention is a crucial metric and benchmark in game development. It is assessed by tracking first-time users and calculating the percentage of those users who return to the app within a specified time frame. Understanding and optimizing this metric is essential for ensuring sustained engagement and long-term success in the highly competitive gaming industry.

### Analytics & Observations
Before exploring solutions, it's crucial to understand the current state of player retention in the mobile gaming market. This includes examining mobile party games and Vanilla's specific retention metrics. Understanding the landscape helps identify improvement opportunities and develop effective strategies to boost player retemtion.

## Gamification
Gamification, as defined by Yu Kai Chou, is "the craft of deriving fun and engaging elements typically found in games and applying them to other contexts." This approach leverages game-like mechanics to enhance user engagement and motivation across various domains, making tasks more enjoyable and compelling. 
 
### Analytics & Observations
To learn which gamification techniques are suitable for Vanilla, we analysed three different contexts;
- [High and low retention games](https://github.com/NickVanGerwen/GamificationForPlayerRetention/blob/Readme/HighAndLowRetentionAnalytics.md)
- [Party games](https://github.com/NickVanGerwen/GamificationForPlayerRetention/blob/Readme/PartyGamesAnalysis.md)
- [Vanilla's games](https://github.com/NickVanGerwen/GamificationForPlayerRetention/blob/Readme/VanillaAnalysis.md)

## Example prototypes
To make the application of gamification techniques in Vanilla's context more tangeable, I prepared prototypes of daily quests, XP levels, and luck systems. These examples demonstrate how such features can integrate  with Vanilla's style while retaining their benefits to player retention and engagement.

These prototypes are substantiated using the [MDA framework] !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
