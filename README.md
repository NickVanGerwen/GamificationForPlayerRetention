## Player Retention
User retention is a key metric and benchmark in game development. It is measured by looking at first time users and calculating the percentage of users that return to your app within a defined timespan.Â 

### Metrics
While there are many ways retention can be measured and used, in the mobile market the most common use case is measuring the amount of new users returning after day 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 180.
This is also written as Dx, where x is the number of days since the user first used the app, ex: D1, D30
