## Player Retention
User retention is a key metric and benchmark in game development. It is measured by looking at first time users and calculating the percentage of users that return to your app within a defined timespan. 

### Metrics
While there are many ways retention can be measured and used, in the mobile market the most common use case is measuring the amount of new users returning after day 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 180.

This is also written as Dx, where x is the number of days since the user first used the app, ex: D1, D30

### Calculating Retention

The basic process of determining player retention is done through these four steps;
1. Decide on an appropriate time period
2. Measure the amount of users at the start of the time period
3. Measure the amount of these users that returned at the end of the time period
4. Divide the amount of new users by the amount of users that returned

### Influencing user retention

According to [Pendo.io](https://www.pendo.io/glossary/user-retention/), user retention can be increased by turning your new users into retained users, this is done in three phases;

Onboarding
New users should be able to use the key features of an app within the first session, this can be done using a well thought out onboarding experience. Onboarding is the process of guiding new users through the most important functionalities of the app so they can start using it immediately. 

Activation
Users should see the value of the app within the first session. Guide them through their first accomplishments to build momentum and motivate them to return.

Habit
If a usage habit is created, the user will return to the app whenever it is deemed necessary by the user. For example, an app which processes expenses will be opened whenever the user receives a receipt they want to scan.
