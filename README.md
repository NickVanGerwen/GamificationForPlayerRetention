## Player Retention
Player retention is a crucial metric and benchmark in game development. It is assessed by tracking first-time users and calculating the percentage of those users who return to the app within a specified time frame. Understanding and optimizing this metric is essential for ensuring sustained engagement and long-term success in the highly competitive gaming industry.

### Analytics & Observations
- [Comparison of high and low retention games]
- [Party games]
- [Vanilla's games]

## Example prototypes
To make the application of gamification techniques in Vanilla's context more tangeable, I prepared prototypes of daily quests, XP levels, and luck systems. These examples demonstrate how such features can integrate  with Vanilla's style while retaining their benefits to player retention and engagement.
