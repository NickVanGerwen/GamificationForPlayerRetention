# Gamification for increased Player Retention
A central hub for the learning from Nick van Gerwen's research project into gamfication and it's impact on player retention, specifically made for Vanilla's development team.

## Player Retention
Player(or user) retention is a key metric and benchmark in game development. It is measured by looking at first time users and calculating the percentage of users that return to your app within a defined timespan. 

### Metrics
While there are many ways retention can be measured and used, in the mobile market the most common use case is measuring the amount of new users returning after day 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 180.

This is also written as Dx, where x is the number of days since the user first used the app, ex: D1, D30

### Calculating Retention

The basic process of determining player retention is done through these four steps;
1. Decide on an appropriate time period
2. Measure the amount of users at the start of the time period
3. Measure the amount of these users that returned at the end of the time period
4. Divide the amount of new users by the amount of users that returned

### Influencing User retention

According to [Pendo.io](https://www.pendo.io/glossary/user-retention/), user retention can be increased by turning your new users into retained users, this is done in three phases;

Onboarding

New users should be able to use the key features of an app within the first session, this can be done using a well thought out onboarding experience. Onboarding is the process of guiding new users through the most important functionalities of the app so they can start using it immediately. 

Activation

Users should see the value of the app within the first session. Guide them through their first accomplishments to build momentum and motivate them to return.

Habit

If a usage habit is created, the user will return to the app whenever it is deemed necessary by the user. For example, an app which processes expenses will be opened whenever the user receives a receipt they want to scan. 

### Scientific models
Scientific models can be used to describe the thought process of returning players. Using them to analyse games may shine a light on what obstacles players need to overcome to play your games, allowing you to address them by streamlining UI, adding new features, or adapt to your playerbase in other ways.

#### The hook model
This model, conceived by Nir Eyal, describes a loop that consists of four components: Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, and Investment. If this loop is implemented effectively it should drive retention by converting users to retained users.
- Trigger: Initiates action
- Action: The desired user response
- Variable Reward: Keeps users engaged with unpredictable rewards
- Investment: User's time or effort

Example of the Hook model;
A group of friends gather and want to play a game(trigger). First, they install and open Gossip(action). Second, they play a game with randomly selected statements, leading to unpredictable discussions, comparisons, and imaginative scenario's(variable reward). After the game, they all have the game installed, understand how it works, and invested their time, making it easier for them to return to the game in the future(investment).

#### The Fogg Behaviour Model
This model, by B.J. Fogg, states that for a behaviour to happen, three factors must align: 
- Motivation, desire to act
- Ability, ease of performing the action
- Trigger, prompt the action

Triggers are most effective when both motivation and ability are high.
