# Vanilla's games analysis
Prior to implementing gamification mechanics, it's essential to analyze Vanilla's own games. This examination aims to identify successful elements and areas for improvement. By understanding how Vanilla applies gamification, we can make informed decisions to optimize the gaming experience and enhance player retention.

## Games

## Categories
To organise the mechanics I make use of seven categories; temporal, social, progression, ownership, luck, resources, and accomplishments. Learn more about them here: [Gamification categories](https://github.com/NickVanGerwen/GamificationForPlayerRetention/blob/Readme/GamificationCategories.md)
