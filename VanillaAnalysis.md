# Vanilla's games analysis
Prior to implementing gamification mechanics, we will analyse Vanilla's own games. This examination aims to identify successful elements and areas for improvement. By understanding how Vanilla applies gamification, we can make informed decisions to optimize the gaming experience and enhance player retention.

## Games
I looked at the following apps;
| game                              |
|-----------------------------------|
| Truth or Dare                     |
| Truth or Dare - Party Game        |
| Truth or Dare Dirty &amp; Extreme |
| Most Likely To                    |
| Never Have I Ever                 |
| Never Have I Ever Dirty Game      |
| Dilemmaly - Would You Rather?     |
| 5 Second Battle                   |
| Kabuki                            |
| King's Cup                        |
| Spin the Botlle The Party game    |
| Gossip                            |
| 2 Truths and 1 Lie                |

## Categories
To organise the mechanics I make use of seven categories; temporal, social, progression, ownership, luck, resources, and accomplishments. Learn more about them here: [Gamification categories](https://github.com/NickVanGerwen/GamificationForPlayerRetention/blob/Readme/GamificationCategories.md)

## Results
|       | temporal           | social                                                                                     | progression | ownership                                                                                      | luck                                                                                         | resources          | accomplishments                          |

## Observations
### Also observed in party games genre;
1. Similar to the party game analysis, Vanilla’s apps all have some form of content selection, which is also used as the main driver behind IAP’s for most of these games. This highlights the importance of applicable content in statement-based games.
2. Almost none of the gamification techniques found in the puzzle games analysis are present here. This is an opportunity to explore a different side of party games, while possibly gaining benefits of mechanics found outside of party games. 
3. Many of the social mechanics are intrinsic to the real-life games they are representing, like comparing players and answers for ‘most likely to’, ‘never have I ever’, and ‘would you rather’. There is an opportunity to apply social mechanics which are not normally available in the real world.
4. Only one temporal mechanic is applied to the party games analysed. There is an opportunity to give different motivations to come back to the apps. 
5. Classic resources like coins and gems are absent from the games analysed. This could be used to give the player more sense of ownership, as well as be a reward for certain actions. Resources could also combine with a cosmetics shop, increasing player choice and sense of ownership.
6. Many of these games are random in nature, through their nature as statement based games. This fact isn’t taken advantage of much, and could be highlighted more with spinning wheels, slot machines, and other visuals related to luck.
7. Game modifiers came in the form of additional rules during the game (ex. ‘Don’t touch the table’, or ‘end every sentence with “duhhh”’). These serve as a form of dynamic gameplay, allowing for variety without the need to implement complicated mechanics.

### Vanilla specific observations
1. Dilemmaly implemented the only temporal mechanic found in all party games analysed, and shows it can work within the context of statement based party games. 
2. Vanilla’s games don’t use a single progression mechanic. There is an opportunity to provide continuous growth and increasing challenges for the players .
3. Many mechanics  are only found once or twice, such as spinning wheels, social prods, and roles. This indicates Vanilla is willing to experiment with unique features in different apps, but few of these are adopted across the entire suite of games.
4. Points and celebrating actions have been included in 4 and 5 apps respectively, indicating they might have been effective in making players feel accomplished. Though they are not implemented in twelve other games. Thus, there is an opportunity to include these tried and tested mechanics in more of Vanilla’s games.
5. Similarly, custom questions and packs are quite common in Vanilla’s games, but not implemented in all of them. There is an opportunity to increase player choice by including them.

### Conclusion
Using the observations I can formulate a list condensing Vanilla’s approach to gamification.
#### Vanilla’s developers have experience with these mechanics;
- Points
- Celebrating actions
- Custom game modes
- Content packs
#### These mechanics have worked for Vanilla in the past, but not to their fullest potential;
- Spinning wheel
- Roles
- Social prods
#### And these areas are prime for improvement / exploration
- Progression
- Highlighting luck-based mechanics
- Temporal mechanics
