# XP Levels
## Mechanics
- Earning XP
  - Daily quests: Players complete specific tasks each day to earn XP.
  - Unlocking badges: Achieving certain milestones or completing unique challenges grants badges, which also award XP.
  - Playing games: Participating in games rewards players with XP based on participation and group size.
- Levelling Up
  - XP thresholds: Each level has a set XP requirement, with higher levels demanding progressively more XP.
  - Level up: Reaching the levelâ€™s XP threshold causes the player to increase their XP level.
  - Content unlocks: Reaching new levels unlocks new content such as game features and cosmetic items.
- Celebrations
  - Achievement graphics: When players level up, a celebratory graphic is displayed, featuring vibrant animations and sound effects.
  - Room notifications: Players are notified when others in the same room level up.

## Dynamics
### One more game
- **Compulsion loop:** Players near a level-up are motivated to play "just one more game" or complete additional quests to gain the necessary XP. This creates a loop where players are continually engaged.
- **Reward anticipation:** The anticipation of reaching the next level and unlocking new rewards encourages extended play sessions.

### Competitive drive
- **Social comparison:** Players can compare their XP levels with friends and other players. This comparison drives them to invest more time and effort into gaining XP.
- **Public recognition:** Seeing other players level up in real-time acts as a motivator, pushing players to keep up or surpass their peers.

### Big groups
- **Group XP boost:** By increasing the XP reward linearly to the amount of players, they are incentivized to gather more people to play with them, leading to more instals. 
- **FOMO:** Seeing a big group play together incites the fear of missing out on that large XP boost. 

### Bragging rights
High-level players receive special titles or badges that are visible to others, providing a status symbol and motivating players to strive for these recognitions.

## Aesthetics
### Challenge
- **Progression goals:** The game provides a clear progression path, challenging players to reach higher levels through strategic quest completion, aiming for badges and extended play sessions..
- **Group play:** The challenge is amplified by playing together with friends or other players, making the experience more engaging and collaborative.

### Sensation
Visual and auditory feedback: Levelling up is marked by elaborate visuals and sounds, such as fireworks, fanfares, and congratulatory messages. This sensory feedback enhances the emotional impact of the achievement.
### Discovery
Surprise unlocks: By limiting the player's knowledge of what they will unlock at specific levels, they will experience a sense of curiosity, and eventually, discovery. This can be enhanced by emphasising unlocks with sensation.
